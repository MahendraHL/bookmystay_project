        </li>
        <li>
        At the hotel's or GOS's sole discretion on case to case basis, the User may also be provided with an option to make a part payment to GOS at the time of confirmation of a booking.

        Some accommodation suppliers may require User and/or the other persons, on behalf of whom the booking is made, to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses that may be incurred during their stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by GOS and solely at the behest of the Hotel.
